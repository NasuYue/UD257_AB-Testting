# Policy and Ethics for Experiments

Most likely subject to
1. IRB review
2. informed consent 

### Sec.1-9 Four princples IRB review

#### 1. risk
Whether the risk exceeds that of “minimal risk”. Minimal risk is defined as the probability and magnitude of harm that a participant would encounter in normal daily life. Exceptions would certainly be any websites or applications that are **health or financial** related

#### 2. Benefits  
It is important to be able to state what the benefit would be from completing the study.

#### 3. Alternatives  
What other choices do participants have?

#### 4. Data Sensitivity  
what data is being collected, and what is the expectation of privacy and confidentiality? This last question is quite nuanced, encompassing numerous questions:

- Do participants understand what data is being collected about them?
- What harm would befall them should that data be made public?
- Would they expect that data to be considered private and confidential?

Data collection with regards to experiments:

- how sensitive is the data and what are the internal safeguards for handling that data? 
- how will it be used and how will participants’ data be protected? How are participants guaranteed that their data, which was collected for use in the study, will not be used for some other purpose? 
- Finally, what data may be published more broadly,and does that introduce any additional risk to the participants

##### Pseudonymous vs anonymous data
- **Identified** data means that data is stored and collected with personally identifiable information.
- **Anonymous** data means that data is stored and collected without any personally identifiable information. This data can be considered **pseudonymous** if it is stored with a randomly generated id such as a cookie that gets assigned on some event, such as the first time that a user goes to an app or website and does not have such an id stored.

### Sec.10 Summary

#### Questions for all proposed studies 
1. Are participants facing more than minimal risk?
2. Do participants understand what data is being gathered?
3. Is that data identifiable?
4. How is the data handled?

#### Exception: user don't need to be informed under
1. minimal risk
2. identifiability


### Sec.12 Internal process recommendations
Finally, regarding internal process of data handling, we recommend that:

1. Every employee who might be involved in A/B test be educated about the ethics and the protection of the participants. Clearly there are other areas of ethics beyond what we’ve covered that discuss integrity, competence, and responsibility, but those generally are broader than protecting participants of A/B tests (cite ACM code of ethics).
2. All data, identified or not, be stored securely, with access limited to those who need it to complete their job. Access should be time limited. 
There should be clear policies of what data usages are acceptable and not acceptable. Moreover, all usage of the data should be logged and audited regularly for violations.

3. You create a clear escalation path for how to handle cases where there is even possibly more than minimal risk or data sensitivity issues.
